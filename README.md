# ML based Crop Recommendation App

## Technical Description

This app uses a Dataset with 2200 Datapoins for Training and for Generating predictions.</br>

Model used:Knn algorithm 

Accuracy: 99.54%

## Run it on your Laptop  now! (New)

Download latest version of python idle

Load/open the code in the python idle

and then run the code

it trains the data set 

it will apper in python shell

the new window should be apper and then enter the paramrters into the window

### Inspiration
Many farmers are confused when making the choice before the sowing season. This app will help them with their choice and save them a lot of time and money.

### What it does

It takes input about the Farmer's soil and tells them which Crop would be best for their soil type using ML prediction.

### How we built it

We have used a dataset of 2200 entries and trained an ML model on it for making the predictions. We have then used python library's to create a user-friendly and simple UI for anyone to use. It uses python to run.

### Challenges we ran into

Finding the right dataset, Training the model for high accuracy. 

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

High Accuracy of our ML model more then 95%.

### What we learned

Machine Learning, Using Python idle.
